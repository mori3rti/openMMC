\begin{DoxyPre}
 \hyperlink{croutine_8h_a05a06feb11028f2d1d440ea335f562ba}{crDELAY( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, TickType\_t xTicksToDelay )};\end{DoxyPre}


Delay a co-\/routine for a fixed period of time.

cr\-D\-E\-L\-A\-Y can only be called from the co-\/routine function itself -\/ not from within a function called by the co-\/routine function. This is because co-\/routines do not maintain their own stack.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\-Handle} & The handle of the co-\/routine to delay. This is the x\-Handle parameter of the co-\/routine function.\\
\hline
{\em x\-Tick\-To\-Delay} & The number of ticks that the co-\/routine should delay for. The actual amount of time this equates to is defined by config\-T\-I\-C\-K\-\_\-\-R\-A\-T\-E\-\_\-\-H\-Z (set in \hyperlink{FreeRTOSConfig_8h}{Free\-R\-T\-O\-S\-Config.\-h}). The constant port\-T\-I\-C\-K\-\_\-\-P\-E\-R\-I\-O\-D\-\_\-\-M\-S can be used to convert ticks to milliseconds.\\

\end{DoxyParams}
Example usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
Co-routine to be created.
 void vACoRoutine( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, UBaseType\_t uxIndex )
 \{
Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
This may not be necessary for const variables.
We are to delay for 200ms.
 static const xTickType xDelayTime = 200 / portTICK\_PERIOD\_MS;\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must start every co-routine with a call to \hyperlink{croutine_8h_a19a57a201a325e8af1207ed68c4aedde}{crSTART()};
     \hyperlink{croutine_8h_a19a57a201a325e8af1207ed68c4aedde}{crSTART( xHandle )};\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     for( ;; )
     \{
Delay for 200ms.

\begin{DoxyPre}Do something here.
     \}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must end every co-routine with a call to \hyperlink{croutine_8h_ae6038cc976689b50000475ebfc4e2f23}{crEND()};
